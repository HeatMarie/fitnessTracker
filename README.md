## Comments 
This was a little pesky fella. It was a start to finish project that will continue to be an on going project. There is major room for growth, but the base and the start is there. 

I'm amazed at the things I learned along the road to completing this assignment. I started out completely confused on how to use merge the use of Modals and APIs and the idea of intertwining them with Handlebars, sigh. That's how I felt. Sad. But in the end I completed it, and I'm happy with that. It's amazing what happens when you have the focus.
